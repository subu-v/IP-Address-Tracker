To get the IP Address locations, you'll be using the\r\n [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, \r\n we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).\r\n\r\nYour users should be able to:\r\n\r\n- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size\r\n- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page\r\n- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load\r\n- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location\r\n\r\n*/\r\n"]}
